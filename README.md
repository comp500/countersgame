# Counters Game Solver
(I've forgotten what it's actually called)

If you host this with a http server (a few ones you may already have are linked [here](https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255)), the index.html page will show you the solver.

It won't work directly from the files due to WebWorker security problems.

This webpage has been tested with Chrome, but most recent browsers should work.
